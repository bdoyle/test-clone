# nyt-books

`npm install` and `bower install` if the grunt task doesn't do it for you automatically

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

Run `grunt buildcontrol:heroku` to deploy to heroku
(not sure if this will work, if you didn't deploy the initialize app)

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
